<p>Dear IRMA user,</p>

<p>Some time ago you opened an IRMA account in your IRMA app, resulting in the
    following record at the
    <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/en">Privacy by Design Foundation</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Username: %s</li>
    <li>Email address: %s</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/privacy-policy-en/">logs</a>
    that the foundation maintains indicate that you have not used this account
    for more than a year. This leads to the question if this account should be kept.</p>

<p>The foundation prefers not to have to keep personal data (like email addresses)
    of unused accounts. For this reason your account will be deleted within two weeks.
    You can prevent this by using the IRMA app with the above account within those two weeks,
    by opening the IRMA app on your phone and entering the (correct) PIN code.
    This prolongs your registration.</p>

<p><strong>About your account</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>It is possible that by now you have another IRMA account,
        with another (pseudonym) username. You can check this by comparing
        the username in your MyIRMA attribute in your IRMA app with the
        above username. If those are not the same, then you do not have
        to do anything: you now have another (active) account, and the old one
        mentioned above will be deleted automatically.</li>

    <li>If you have forgotten your PIN code and you wish to stop using this
        account, then you can uninstall the IRMA app from your phone.
        This account will then be deleted automatically after two weeks.</li>

    <li>If you have forgotten your PIN code and you want to keep using the
        IRMA app, then you can reregister. You then receive a new IRMA account
        with which you can collect new attributes in your IRMA app.
        The old account will be deleted automatically.</li>

    <li>You can see the logs that the foundation maintains on your account at all times
        by logging in with your MyIRMA attribute or your email address at
        <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/myirma">MyIRMA</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information on IRMA and on user accounts
    <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-start">here</a>.</p>

<p>
    Kind regards,<br/>
